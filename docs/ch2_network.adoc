===  Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

An `Azure VNet` provides the ability to set up custom virtual networking which includes subnets, and
IP address ranges. In this reference implementation
guide, a dedicated `VNet` is created with all its accompanying services to provide a
stable network for the OpenShift v3 deployment.

A `VNet` is created as a logical representation of a networking environment in the `Azure`
cloud. The following subnets and CIDR listed below are used. Substitute the values
to ensure no conflict with an existing CIDR or subnet in the environment. The values
are defined in `https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib/tree/master/reference-architecture/azure-ansible/azuredeploy.json`.

.VNet Networking
|====
^|CIDR / Subnet ^| Values

| CIDR | 10.0.0.0/16
| Master Subnet 1 | 10.0.0.0/24
| Node Subnet 2 | 10.0.1.0/24
| Infra Subnet 3 | 10.0.2.0/24
|====

The `VNet` is created and a human readable tag is assigned. Three subnets are created in the `VNet`.
The bastion instance is on the Master Subnet.
The two internal `Load Balancers` allow access to the OpenShift masters and the routing of application
traffic. The Nodes are able to communicate to the internet for packages, container images, and
Github repositories.
