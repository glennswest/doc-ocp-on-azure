=== Registry

OpenShift can build Docker images from your source code, deploy them, and
manage their lifecycle. To enable this, OpenShift provides an internal,
integrated Docker registry that can be deployed in your OpenShift environment
to manage images.

The registry stores Docker images and metadata. For production environment, you
should use persistent storage for the registry, otherwise any images
anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear if the pod were to restart.

Using the installation methods described in this document the registry is
deployed using Azure Blob Storage.
