=== Registry
OpenShift can build container images from source code, deploy them, and
manage their lifecycle. To enable this it is required to deploy the
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[Integrated OpenShift Container Platform Registry]

The registry stores container images and metadata. For production environment,
persistent storage is used for the registry, otherwise any images
built or pushed into the registry would disappear if the pod were to restart.

Using the installation methods described in this document the registry is
deployed using `Azure Blob Storage`

NOTE: For more information about the Azure Blob Storage, see: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/
