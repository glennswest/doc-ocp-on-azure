[[Provision-Ansible]]

=== Provisioning Prerequisites
The script and playbooks provided within the git repository deploys
infrastructure, installs and configures *{ocp}*, and performs post installation
tasks such as scaling the router and registry. The playbooks create specific
roles, policies, and users required for cloud provider configuration in *{ocp}*, as well as
storage accounts on *{ma}*. In order to deploy *{ocp}* on *{ma}*, an `ARM` template must be created. The `ARM`
template takes the basic information, admin user name, password, *Red Hat Subscription Manager* username and password,
`SSH` public and private keys, as well as offering the ability to size the virtual machines.

==== Authentication Prerequisites
The template creates an *{ocp}* user using the supplied values `adminUsername` and `adminPassword`
in the `ARM` template parameters when creating the infrastructure and it will be granted the `cluster-admin` role for the *{ocp}* environment.

==== SSH Prerequisites

===== SSH Configuration
The `SSH` service will be configured during the deployment to allow connections using a public key. To make this work, the same public and private key that were created before will be used for the admin user in the instances.
Before beginning the deployment of the *{ma}* infrastructure and the deployment of *{ocp}*, the `SSH`
*private key* must be converted into a base64 string. Otherwise, the *{ma}* infrastructure cannot be configured
manually or automatically.

NOTE: The reason to convert the private key to a base64 string is to avoid possible issues with multiple lines and carriage return characters

This task is performed locally, on the machine that will run the `ARM` template. In this example,
the private key is converted to base64 encoding, and placed on the clipboard.

* For RHEL/CentOS:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64 | tr -d '\n' | xclip -selection clipboard*
----

* For OSX:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy*
----

* For Windows use a Base 64 Encoder app or website to perform the conversion

==== Red Hat Subscription Prerequisites
A *Red Hat account* is required to use this template. This account must have appropriate
subscriptions available in the account in order to use the template. Either a username
and password may be supplied, or an `organization ID` and `activation key`.

To be able to access the RPM packages the `Pool ID` for the subscriptions is required. The next section will show how to locate the `Pool ID`.

===== Red Hat Subscription Pool ID
In order to assign a subscription, a `Pool ID` is required. Using a system that currently has a valid subscription
to Red Hat products, by using `subscription-manager` the `Pool ID` can be acquired. Perform the following command, and take
note of the `Pool ID`.

[subs=+quotes]

----

NOTE: The `Pool ID` is also available in the https://access.redhat.com/management/subscriptions[*Subscriptions*] section of the *Red Hat Customer Portal*, by selecting the appropriate subscription that will open a detailed view of the subscription, including the `Pool ID`

==== Organization ID and Activation Key
Instead using username/password combination, an `activation key` and `organization ID` can be used.
The `activation key` is a simple string, chosen by the end-user that contains the subscriptions the user attaches to it to avoid using passwords in the registration procedure.
The `organization ID` is the Red Hat `ID` for the customer organizations and it is required when using activation keys to identify the activation keys within the organization.

Perform the following steps to obtain the `organization ID` and activation key.

===== Generating Activation Key
1. Go to the *Red Hat Customer Portal* located in http://access.redhat.com and login with your Red Hat username and password. Select *[Subscriptions]* section in the top left corner then the tab https://access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys["Activation keys"]

2. Create your key selecting the https://access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys/new["New Activation Key"] button

Once in there give your key a name, set service level to standard or premium, and add the subscriptions containing *{ocp}*.

===== Getting the Organization ID
In order to find the `organization ID`, a `RHEL` server is required. Perform the following on a existing `RHEL` server.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *subscription-manger identity*
system identity: 8c85ab6d-495c-451e-b38e-5f09bc3342a0
name: bastion
org name: 6616399
org ID: 6616399
----

Find the value labeled `org ID:` and save this somewhere for use during the deployment.

===== Using the Organization ID and Activation Key
When running the `ARM` template, use the `organization ID` as the RHN User Name, and use the
`activation key` as the RHN Password.

==== Azure Active Directory Credentials
It is required to create a *{ma}* service principal in order to be able to deploy the infrastructure using the `ARM` template.
The service principal object defines the policy and permissions for an application's use in a specific tenant, providing the basis for a security principal to represent the application at run-time.

NOTE: For more information about the service principal objects in `Azure Active Directory` see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli[Use Azure CLI to create a service principal to access resources]

In order to create the `Azure Active Directory` (`AAD`) client id, and password, the *Node.js* `Azure CLI` package is required.

Follow this instructions to create it in a RHEL/CentOS/Fedora system:

1. Install *Node.js*
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *sudo yum -y install npm*
----
+
2. Install the `Azure CLI` *Node.js* package:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *sudo npm install -g azure-cli*
----
+
3. Login to *{ma}*:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *azure login*
----
+
4. Create a service principal:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *azure ad sp create -n <service_principal_name> -p <password>*
----
+
The following is an example output:

+
Save the `Object Id` and the `Service Principal Names GUID` values from the command output.
+
* The `Object Id` will be used to create the role assignment.
* The `Service Principal Names GUID` will be used as the `aadClientId` parameter value (Application ID/Client ID) in the template.
* The password entered as part of the CLI command will be the `aadClientSecret` paramter value in the template.
+
5. Show the *{ma}* account data:

=== Introduction to the *{ma}* Template
`Azure Resource Manager` templates consist of json files that describes the objects that will be deployed in *{ma}*. The main template file for this reference architecture is located in the `reference-architecture/azure-ansible/azuredeploy.json` file in the git repository.
This file is the main `ARM` template that launches all the other templates under `azure-ansible`.
There are four types of virtual machines created by the template (bastion, master node, infrastructure node and application node) and for each of these types there is a additional json file that defines each VM type.

|====
^|Virtual Machine type ^| Template file

|Bastion| `reference-architecture/azure-ansible/bastion.json`
|Master| `reference-architecture/azure-ansible/master.json`
|Infrastructure node| `reference-architecture/azure-ansible/infranode.json`
|Application node| `reference-architecture/azure-ansible/node.json`
|====

The `ARM` template for each type, automatically starts a bash shell script that does part of the initial setup.
The main shell script is the `reference-architecture/azure-ansible/bastion.sh` that handles the generation
of the ansible host inventory, as well as the setup and running of ansible across all the hosts. The bastion host also provides isolation of all the hosts in the resource group from the public internet for the purpose of `SSH` access.

=== Provision the *{ocp}* environment
In order to provision the *{ocp}* environment using the `ARM` template, the following information is required:

* A *{ma}* subscription, with appropriate core and VM quota limits.
* *Resource Group* - Used as the name of the *{ocp}* Cluster - All the assets of a single cluster use the `Azure Resource Group` to organize and group the assets. This name needs to be unique for each cluster per `Azure Region` (Location).
* Admin username and password - This will be the admin user, used for multiple purposes:
   a. As the `SSH` user to be able to connect to the bastion host, and administer the cluster.
   b. As an *{ocp}* administrative user, able to create and control *{ocp}* from the command line, or the user interface.
* *SSH Key Data* - This is the *public key* (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`), generated for the user that will be used to `SSH` access to all the VMs. During the creation and installation of *{ocp}* virtual machines, the key will automatically be added to each host. This assures proper security and access. This key must be backed up, as its the only principal way to access the cluster for administration.
* *SSH Private Data* - This is the *private key* `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file contents that has been base64 encoded. During the creation and installation of *{ocp}* virtual machines, the key will automatically be added to each host. This data should be backed up.
* *Wildcard Zone* - Hostname for applications in the *{ocp}* cluster (required by the load balancer, but *nip.io* will be used)
* *Number of Nodes* - The template supports the creation of 3 to 30 nodes during greenfield creation of a cluster. Note that the quota of the *{ma}* account must support the number chosen.
* *Image* - The template supports `RHEL` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) 7.3 or later. The image will be upgraded during the installation process to the latest release.
* *Master VM Size* (default: `Standard_DS4_v2`) - The default value gives 8 CPU Cores, 28 Gigabytes of memory, with 56 GB of premium storage local disk. This is used for *{ocp}* master nodes, as well as the bastion host.
* *Infranode VM Size* (default: `Standard_DS4_v2`) - The default value gives 8 CPU Cores, 28 Gigabytes of memory, with 56 GB of premium storage local disk. Infrastructure nodes run the *{ocp}* routers and the *{ocp}* registry pods. As the infrastructure nodes provide the ingress for all applications, its recommended that _DS2_ be the smallest node used for the infrastructure nodes.
* *Node VM Size* (default: `Standard_DS4_v2`) - The default value gives 8 CPU Cores, 28 Gigabytes of memory, with 56 GB of premium storage local disk. Application nodes is where the application containers run.
* *RHN Username* - This should be the username used for the *Red Hat Subscription Account* that has *{ocp}* entitlements, or the `Organization ID` if using activation keys.
* *RHN Password* - This should be the password for the Red Hat Subscription Account, or the `activation key` if using activation keys.
* *Subscription Pool ID* - This is a number sequence that uniquely identifies the subscriptions that are to be used for the *{ocp}* installation.
* *AAD Client Id* - This gives *{ocp}* the `Active Directory ID`, needed to be able to create, move and delete persistent volumes.
* *AAD Client Secret* - The `Active Directory Password` to match the AAD Client ID. Required to create persistent volumes.

With the above information ready, go to https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib/tree/master/reference-architecture/azure-ansible
and click the *[Deploy To Azure]* button near the bottom of the page. This will then show the form, to allow the deployment to be started.

=== Post Ansible Deployment
Once the playbooks have successfully completed the next steps will be to perform the steps defined in <<Operational-Management>>.
In the event that *{ocp}* failed to install, follow the steps in Appendix C: <<Installation-Failure>> to restart the installation of *{ocp}*.
