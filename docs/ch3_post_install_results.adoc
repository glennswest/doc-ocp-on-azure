=== Post Provisioning Results
At this point the infrastructure and *{rhocp}* have been deployed. Log into the `Azure web console` and check the resources. In the `Azure web console`, check for the following resources:

* 3 master nodes
* 3 infrastructure nodes
* 3 or more application nodes
* 1 unique virtual network
* 3 public IPs
* 10 network interfaces
* 4 network security groups
* 5 storage accounts
* 2 load balancer profiles
* 2 load balancer DNS entries

After the `Azure Resource Manager` template is submitted, and the `ARM` deployment
succeeds, the ansible install is started automatically.

A wildcard DNS entry must be created if a custom domain is required, by default the nip.io service is be used as explained in the <<ch2_dns.adoc,Microsoft Azure DNS>> section.

NOTE: When installing using this method the browser certificate must be accepted three times due to the number of masters in the cluster. Failure to accept the certificate can cause disconnect issues and the appearance of network failures.
