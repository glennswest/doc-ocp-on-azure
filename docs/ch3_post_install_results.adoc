=== Post Provisioning Results

At this point the infrastructure and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform have been deployed. Log into the `Azure` console and check the resources. In the `Azure` console, check for the following resources:

* 3 Master nodes
* 3 Infrastructure nodes
* 3 or more Application nodes
* 1 Unique Virtual Network
* 3 Public IPs
* 10 Network Interfaces
* 4 Network Security Groups
* 5 Storage accounts
* 2 Load Balancer Profiles
* 2 Load Balancer DNS entries

After the Azure Resource Manager template is submitted, and the ARM deployment
succeeds, the ansible install is started.

A DNS entry must be created in your custom domain. This will consist of a DNS "C" record
that points to the wildcardzone name.




NOTE: When installing using this method the browser certificate must be accepted three times. The certificate must be accepted three times due to the number of masters in the cluster. Failure to accept the certificate can cause disconnect issues and the appearance of network failures.
