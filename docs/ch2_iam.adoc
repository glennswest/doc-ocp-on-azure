====  Identity and Access Management
For this reference account, an Azure account is required. Ideally this is either a pay-as-you-go
account, or a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement.

You must have enough resources to deploy the reference architecture, otherwise the installation will fail.

During the installation of *OpenShift Container Platform* using the reference architecture scripts and playbooks, six storage accounts
are created automatically per cluster:

* _samas<resourcegroup>_ - For masters storage
* _sanod<resourcegroup>_ - For application nodes storage
* _sainf<resourcegroup>_ - For infrastructure nodes storage
* _sareg<resourcegroup>_ - For registry persistent volume storage
* _sapv1<resourcegroup>_ - For the `generic storage class`
* _sapv2<resourcegroup>_ - For a non default storage class
