====  Identity and Access Management
For this reference account, a *{ma}* account is required. Ideally this is either a pay-as-you-go
account, or a *Microsoft Enterprise Agreement*.

You must have enough resources to deploy the reference architecture, otherwise the installation will fail.

During the installation of *{ocp}* using the reference architecture scripts and playbooks, six storage accounts
are created automatically per cluster:

* `samas<resourcegroup>` - For masters storage
* `sanod<resourcegroup>` - For application nodes storage
* `sainf<resourcegroup>` - For infrastructure nodes storage
* `sareg<resourcegroup>` - For registry persistent volume storage
* `sapv1<resourcegroup>` - For the `generic` storage class
* `sapv2<resourcegroup>` - For a non default storage class

NOTE: For more information about the *{ma}* identity management and storage accounts, see
