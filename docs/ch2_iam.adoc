====  Identity and Access Management

For this reference account, an Azure Account is required. Ideally this is either a pay-as-you-go
account, or a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement.

You must have enough resources to deploy the reference architecture.


During the installation of OpenShift Container Platform, four Storage accounts
are created automatically per cluster. One is created for infrastructure, one for masters, 
one for nodes, and one for store1.
