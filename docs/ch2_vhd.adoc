====  Azure Storage - Azure VHD

For the use cases considered in this reference architecture, including OpenShift applications that connect to containerized databases or need some
basic persistent storage, we need to consider multiple storage solutions in the cloud and different architectural approaches. Microsoft Azure offers
a number of  storage choices that offer high durability with three simultaneous replicas, including Standard and Premium storage.

Furthermore, a use case requirement is to implement “shared storage”. Upon reviewing multiple options supported by OpenShift and the underlying
Red Hat Enterprise Linux infrastructure, a choice was made to use an Azure VHD based storage server to give the Azure OCP nodes the best match of performance
and flexibility. The reference architecture will be updated with further storage choices (such as Managed Disks) as they are evaluated.

The azure cloud provider plugin for OpenShift will dynamically allocate storage in the pre-created
storage accounts based on requests for PV. (OCP Version 3.5).

A default storage profile is created, and installed. Any persistent volume claim will result in a new
vhd being created in the selected storage account. The vhd will be mounted and formated, and allocated to
the container making the request.
