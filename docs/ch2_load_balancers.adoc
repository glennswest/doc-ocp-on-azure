====  Azure Load Balancer

`Azure` provides an Azure Load Balancer `ALBs` service which enables distribution of traffic
across multiple instances in the `Azure` cloud.  Two `ALBs` are used in the deployment of
OpenShift one for the router, and one for
external master communication.  There are clear advantages to doing this:

* Keeps applications highly available.
* It is secure, it works with the `Azure` cloud to leverage features such as separation of public / private cloud traffic
and health monitoring.

Azure Load Balancer itself is fully-fault tolerant, and designed for implementing native azure highly-available applications.

`Azure Load Balancer` implements parts of the <<Routing Layer>>.
