==== Azure Load Balancer
Azure provides an `Azure Load Balancer` (`ALBs`) service which enables distribution of traffic
across multiple instances in the Azure cloud.  Two `ALBs` are used in the deployment of
OpenShift:

* To expose a single entry point for applications exposed to outside using the OpenShift routers
* To expose a single entry point for the OpenShift API and console

There are clear advantages to doing this:

* Keeps applications highly available.
* It is secure, it works with the `Azure` cloud to leverage features such as separation of public / private cloud traffic
and health monitoring.

Azure Load Balancer itself is fully-fault tolerant, and designed for implementing native azure highly-available applications.

NOTE: For more information see the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview[Azure Load Balancer documentation]

`Azure Load Balancer` implements parts of the <<Routing Layer>>.
