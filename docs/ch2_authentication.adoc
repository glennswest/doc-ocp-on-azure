===  Authentication
There are several options when it comes to authentication of users in OpenShift Container Platform.
OpenShift can leverage an existing identity provider within an organization such as `LDAP`
or OpenShift can use external identity providers like GitHub, Google, and GitLab.
The configuration of identification providers occurs on the OpenShift master instances.
OpenShift allows for multiple identity providers to be specified.
The reference architecture document uses htpasswd as the authentication provider
but any of the other mechanisms would be an acceptable choice.
Roles can be added to user accounts to allow for extra privileges such as the ability
to list nodes or assign persistent storage volumes to a project.

For best practice on Authentication, consult the reference-architecture for
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/red-hat-xpaas-sso-image/[Keycloak].
Keycloak allows a fully federated central authentication service that can be used by both
developers and end-users across multiple identity providers, using a simple user interface.
