===  OpenShift Pods

OpenShift leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.  For example, a pod could be just a single php application connecting to a database outside of the OpenShift environment or a pod could be a php application that has an ephemeral database.  OpenShift pods have the ability to be scaled at runtime or at the time of launch using the OpenShift console or the `oc` CLI tool.  Any container running in the environment is considered a pod. The pods containing the OpenShift router and registry are required to be deployed in the OpenShift environment.
