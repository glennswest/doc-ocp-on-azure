=== Bastion
The bastion server implements mainly two distinct functions. One is that of a secure way to
connect to all the nodes, and second that of the "installer" of the system. The information provided to the _ARM template_ is
passed to the bastion host and from there, playbooks and scripts are automatically generated
and executed, resulting in the OpenShift system being installed.

As shown in the <<bastion-diagram>> the bastion server in this reference architecture
provides a secure way to limit _SSH_ access to the Azure environment.
The master and node security groups only allow for _SSH_ connectivity between
nodes inside of the Security Group while the bastion allows _SSH_ access
from everywhere. The bastion host is the only ingress point for _SSH_ in the cluster
from external entities. When connecting to the OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure,
the bastion forwards the request to the appropriate server.

NOTE: Connecting to other VMs through the bastion server requires specific _SSH_ configuration which is outlined in the deployment section of the reference architecture guide.
