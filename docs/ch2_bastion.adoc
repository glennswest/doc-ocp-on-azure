=== Bastion
The bastion server implements mainly two distinct functions. One is that of a secure way to
connect to all the nodes, and second that of the "installer" of the system. The information provided to the `ARM template` is
passed to the bastion host and from there, playbooks and scripts are automatically generated
and executed, resulting in the OpenShift Container Platform system being installed.

As shown in the <<bastion-diagram>> the bastion server in this reference architecture
provides a secure way to limit `SSH` access to the Azure environment.
The master and node security groups only allow for `SSH` connectivity between
nodes inside of the Security Group while the bastion allows `SSH` access
from everywhere. The bastion host is the only ingress point for `SSH` in the cluster
from external entities. When connecting to the OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure,
the bastion forwards the request to the appropriate server.

NOTE: Connecting to other VMs through the bastion server requires specific `SSH` configuration which is outlined in the deployment section of the reference architecture guide.
